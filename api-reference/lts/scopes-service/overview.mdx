# Scopes service overview

The Scopes service provides API capabilities to manage data scopes within Coralogix, enabling fine-grained segmentation of logs and metrics for specific teams, applications, or services. A scope defines a logical boundary using entity filters and expressions, allowing for controlled visibility, permissions, and team-specific access. This service allows users to create, retrieve (individually or in bulk), update, and delete scopes tied to a team. Each scope includes metadata such as a display name, description, team ID, and customizable filters targeting specific entity types.

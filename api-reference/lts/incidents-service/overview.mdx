# Incidents service overview

Handle all operations related to incident management within Coralogix. Identify, manage, and resolve incidents efficiently through automated workflows and team collaboration.

Find out more about incident management in our [documentation](https://coralogix.com/docs/user-guides/alerting/incidents/).

## Authentication and permissions

To use the Incidents service API you need to [create a personal or team API key](https://coralogix.com/docs/user-guides/account-management/api-keys/api-keys/). It's recommended to use permission presets, as they are automatically updated with all relevant permissions. Alternatively, you can manually add the following individual permissions.

| Presets | Permission            | Description                                      |
|---------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Incidents | `incidents:acknowledge` | Access to incidents operations |
|  | `incidents:assign` | Access to incidents operations |
|  | `incidents:close` | Access to incidents operations |
|  | `incidents:read` | Grants access to read incidents |

## Common error response codes

| Status Code | Description                           |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| `400 Bad Request` | Response code 400 |

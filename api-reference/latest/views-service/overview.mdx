# Views service overview

Coralogix Views enable users to save and manage customized data explorations, including search queries, filters, and time ranges. The API supports full CRUD operations to create, update, retrieve, list, and delete views. Each view encapsulates query logic, visual parameters (e.g., compact mode), and optional folder grouping, allowing teams to reuse or share analytical configurations across environments. This service helps streamline common investigation patterns and promotes consistency in observability workflows.
